You are trundling in the back of a heavily armoured car. You’ve been convicted of a crime
you didn’t commit, a horrendous thing. The thing is, you know exactly who did it. A gang that used a
house neighbouring yours as a base. You just can’t prove it, not without some evidence. Luckily, 
some of them were caught for something way more minor, and are going to be in the clink with you.

You’ll get one more appeal before they give you the injection. You need to make it count. If you 
keep your ears sharp, you may catch something you can use.
